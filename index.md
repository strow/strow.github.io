The Atmospheric Spectroscopy Laboratory (ASL) is a member of the UMBC
Physics Department and UMBC Joint Center for Earth System Science
(JCET).  We help NASA and NOAA develop hyperspectral infrared
satellite instruments used for numerical weather prediction and for
climate studies. Scientific studies done by ASL using these
instruments include measurements of volcanic eruptions, dust storms,
atmospheric CO and CO$$_2$$ variability, and surface emissivity
variability.  We are presently working to improve the calibration of
the existing satellite hyperspectral sensors in order to produce
climate-quality radiance time-series for climate change studies.

Our work concentrates on three satellite instruments: AIRS (EOS-AQUA),
CrIS (SNPP), and IASI (METOP).  All three of these hyperspectral
infrared radiometers fly in polar orbits, thus mapping out most of the
earth twice per day.  AIRS, NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder flying
on the EOS-AQUA platform, started operation in late August, 2002 and
has an equator crossing time of 1:30.  IASI-1/2 flies on the EUMETSAT
METOP-A/B platforms with equator crossing times of 9:30.  CrIS flies
on the Soumi NPP (SMPP) satellite with the same 1:30 crossing time as
AIRS.  The next CrIS sensor will be part of the NOAA/NASA JPSSS
satellite system now in development.
