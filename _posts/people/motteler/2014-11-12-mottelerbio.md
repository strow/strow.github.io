AIRS Work Page
--------------

This is the old AIRS work page, mainly just here as a placeholder, though the HITRAN
tools are probably still useful.

- Version 2.2 of a set of Matlab HDF 4 tools, including an RTP API, is available as a
  [tar file](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/h4tools.tar); see the
  [README](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/h4tools/README) there for more
  information. Version 2.2 includes sdload.m and sdsave.m, an easy-to-use interface to
  HDF4 SD and NetCDF files.

- Version 1.05 of the RTP (Radiative Transfer Profile) package, including the Fortran
  and C API, tools, and documentation, is available as a [tar
  file](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/rtpV105.tar). The package includes a
  top-level [README](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/rtpV105/README), a list of
  [changes](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/rtpV105/doc/CHANGES) from earlier
  versions, and a user's guide in
  [html](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/rtpV105/doc/rtpspec.html) and
  [pdf](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/hdf/rtpV105/doc/rtpspec.pdf) formats.

- HITRAN database tools -- Matlabs procedure to access a HITRAN database, and Unix
  tools to manipulate HITRAN-format files. A short
  [README](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_hitr06/README), more extensive
  [documentation](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_hitr06/read_hitr.txt), and a
  [tar file](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_hitr06/read_hitr06.tgz) of the
  package are available.

- HITRAN IR cross section tools -- Matlab procedures to read and manipulate HITRAN IR
  cross section data, including a procedure to return absorptions calculated from
  interpolation or extrapolation of HITRAN tabulated cross-section data. A short
  [README](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_xsec/README), more extensive
  [documentation](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_xsec/read_xsec.txt), and a
  [tar file](http://asl.umbc.edu/pub/motteler/read_xsec/read_xsec.tgz) of the package
  are available. The tar file includes a version of the HITRAN 98 IR cross-section
  data with several minor data errors fixed.
