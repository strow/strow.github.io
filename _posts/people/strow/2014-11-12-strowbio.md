<h2> Research Professor of Physics</h2>

<br>

I lead the Atmospheric Spectroscopy Laboratory ([ASL](/index.html))
group at UMBC.  We are also affiliated with the UMBC/NASA Joint Center
for Earth Systems Technology ([JCET](http://jcet.umbc.edu)).  Our
research centers on the development and use of high-spectral
resolution infrared satellite sounders.  These relatively new
instruments provide critical observational information to numerical
weather prediction centers for preparing forecasts, while also
providing new space-borne global measurements of various minor
constituents (carbon monoxide, methane, dust, volcanic ash and sulpher
dioxide, carbon dioxide).  ASL participated in the development of all
three existing hyperspectral sounders (AIRS, IASI, and CrIS),
especially with regard to the pre- and post-launch calibration of the
two U.S. instruments (AIRS, CrIS).  Our current research centers on
using these sensors for global measurements of climate change.
