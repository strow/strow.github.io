* Tell kramdown to a TOC

## Introduction

HowardThis article serves as a template for you to write your own articles
or posts.  This is not pure Markdown, but includes various commands
introduced by Octopress to make writing easier.  I have modified the
stock Octopress to fix tables and to allow the use of LaTeX math
commands.  Your first source for documentation should be the
[Octopress Documentation Site](http://octopress.org/docs/).  This
sentence also shows you how to do a link.  Note that
``aslblog/source`` is the top of the web site file system; note in
this sentence how to highlight a file specification or very small code
block.

If you want a table of contents, you must be using the kramdown
processor to generate these web pages with ruby (hopefully soon to be
installed on tara).  To do this put the following code above your
first heading.

## Code Blocks

Sharing code snippets is really easy, and there are several ways to do
it.  I'm going to show you the easiest, backtick code blocks.  You
just use three backticks to enclose the code.  On the first line,
after the first three backticks you can add additional information,
namely, ``[language] [title] [url] [link text]``.  Here is a Matlab
code snippet, and yes, Octopress knows Matlab syntax well enough for
highlighting.

{% highlight matlab linenos %}
function bt = rad2bt(fr, rad);
% function bt = rad2bt(fr, rad);
%
% Translate radiances to brightness temperatures
%
% Input: 
%    fr - vector of wavenumber (cm-1)
%    rad - vector or column-order array of radiances (mW/m2 per cm-1 per strad)
%
% Output
%    bt - vector or column-order array of brightness temp's
%

% H. Motteler, 8/27/98
% Update: 24 Jun 02 Scott Hannon - use milliwatts instead of Watts; adjust
%    Planck and Boltzmann to use NIST/CODATA98 values.  Also renamed "rd"
%    to "rad" to match name used in "bt2rad.m".
% Update: 27 May 2009, Breno Imbiriba - modify dimension checks to correct
%    inconsistency when f is [1 x 1].
% Update: 27 May 2009, Paul Schou - extended the function to work in N dimensions
% Note: constants are NIST/CODATA98 values

% Constants; values from NIST (CODATA98)
c = 2.99792458e+08;  % speed of light      299 792 458 m s-1
h = 6.62606876e-34;  % Planck constant     6.626 068 76 x 10-34 J s
k = 1.3806503e-23;   % Boltzmann constant  1.380 6503 x 10-23 J K-1

% Compute radiation constants c1 and c2
c1 = 2*h*c*c * 1e+11;  % Changed 1e+8 to 1e+11 to convert Watts to milliWatts
c2 = (h*c/k) * 100;

% return bt = c2 * fr / log(1 + c1 * fr^3 / rad)

% if only 1 frequency is given, apply to all
if length(fr) == 1
  bt = c2 * fr ./ log(1 + c1 * (fr.^3) ./ rad);
  return
end

% if rad is 3 dimensions or more, flatten to 2 first
rad_dims = size(rad);
if length(rad_dims) > 2
  rad = reshape(rad,rad_dims(1),[]);
end

[m1 n1]=size(fr);
[m2 n2]=size(rad);
if(n1~=1)
  fr=fr';
  [m1 n1]=size(fr);
end
if(m2~=m1)
  if(n2==m1)
    rad=rad';
  else
    error(['Wrong argument size']);
  end
end
n=n2;

bt = c2 * (fr * ones(1,n)) ./ log(1 + c1 * (fr.^3 * ones(1,n)) ./ rad);

% if the radiances are 3D or more, expand them back out to the original dims
if length(rad_dims) > 2
  bt = reshape(bt,rad_dims);
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here is an example of a table. You must put a space between the text
here and the table.

| Left Column     | Center Column         | Right Column |
|:----------------|:---------------------:|-------------:|
| Left Just.      | Right Just.           | Center Just. |
| First entry     | *emphasize entry*     |Inline Math: $$\beta = \gamma$$ |
| C1R2            | **bold entry**        | Something |
| C1R3            | C2R3                  | Something |

I cannot figure out how to get a spacing after the table.  


## Lists

Now let's try an itemized list:

* First item, make it long; First item, make it long; First item, make
  it long 
* Second item
* Third item

1. First item, make it long; First item, make it long; First item, make
  it long 
3. Second item
2. Third item

Note above that I did not number the enumerated list properly, but
Octopress renumbered it correctly.
